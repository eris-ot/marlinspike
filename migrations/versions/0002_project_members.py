"""project_members — shared project access

Adds project_members join table so projects can be shared across users
with viewer | editor | owner roles.  The project creator's ownership
stays in projects.user_id; this table adds invited members only.

Existing deployments: run ``python -m marlinspike.db upgrade head`` to
apply this migration.
